===================
Project Description
===================

HTTPDB is a very simple and fast publically accessible key:value datastore that runs on App Engine. The idea is to give developers who have rich client applications the ability to store application information in the cloud with no setup. As a naming convention, the developer should strictly define data structures on the front end with keys such as "Class:Identifier:Property" which could map to something like "User:105:foo" which holds the value "bar".

=====================
External Dependencies
=====================

The current incantation of the code is built on Google App Engine, however it disregards App Engine's built-in framework which uses webapp and a stripped down Django. 

Cherrypy framework to map urls and handle general requests
- http://www.cherrypy.org/

simplejson to help convert the Protocol Buffer formatted db entities to pretty JSON strings
- http://pypi.python.org/pypi/simplejson/

App Engine Datastore api to store the data
- http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/source/browse/trunk/python/google/appengine/api/datastore.py

===============
Current Example
===============

Request for Empty Data
~: curl http://httpdbapp.appspot.com/get/foo/
{}

Set Key to Value:
~: curl http://httpdbapp.appspot.com/set/foo/bar/
SET

Re-Consume the Data:
~: curl http://httpdbapp.appspot.com/get/foo/
{"foo": "bar"}


Started Using CherryPy wsgi framework. feature stripped, 10-20ms response.
